# Antigravity Proxy for Cursor

A high-fidelity bridge that brings Google's latest **Gemini 3** and **Claude 4.5** models directly into your Cursor IDE with full Agentic and Composer support.

## Why Antigravity Proxy?
Google's advanced agentic models (internal versions of Gemini/Claude) use a specific protocol that standard OpenAI-compatible clients (like Cursor) cannot understand natively. This proxy:
1.  **Translates Protocols**: Converts OpenAI requests into Google's Agentic format.
2.  **Injects Thought Signatures**: Automatically handles the complex reasoning traces required for tool calling.
3.  **Bridges Authentication**: Securely extracts your local Cloud Code session tokens so you don't need manual API keys.

## 🛠️ How it Works: The Cloudflare Tunnel
When you run `npm start`, the engine launches two processes:
1.  **Local Proxy Server**: Runs on `localhost:3000`.
2.  **Cloudflare Quick Tunnel**: Creates a secure, temporary HTTPS bridge from the internet's edge directly to your local proxy.

### Why is the Tunnel necessary?
*   **HTTPS Requirement**: High-security IDEs like Cursor often require a valid, trusted HTTPS endpoint to talk to custom models.
*   **Zero-Config Networking**: It allows the proxy to work through firewalls and VPNs without you having to open any ports or touch router settings.
*   **Security**: The tunnel provides a random, difficult-to-guess URL that is only active while your process is running.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Dynamic URLs**: Because we are using Cloudflare's *Quick Tunnel* mode (free version), a **fresh URL is generated every time you restart the script**. You will need to update the URL in Cursor whenever the terminal shows a new one.

## Prerequisites: The "Session Bridge"
For this proxy to work, it MUST be able to see your local Google authorization.
*   **Keep Antigravity/VS Code Logged In**: You must have the Google Cloud Code (Antigravity) extension installed and be **logged in** with your account.
*   **Active Session**: The proxy extracts tokens dynamically. If you sign out of the extension, the proxy will stop working until you sign back in.

## Setup Instructions

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

Docker runs the proxy and Cloudflare tunnel in an isolated container. You still need an active Antigravity/Cursor session on the host — the container reads your local auth database via a volume mount.

#### 1. Configure the auth database path

Copy the example env file and set the path to your local `state.vscdb`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set `AUTH_DB_HOST_PATH` to your auth database:

| Platform | Typical path |
|----------|--------------|
| macOS (Antigravity) | `~/Library/Application Support/Antigravity/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` |
| Linux (Cursor) | `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` |

#### 2. Build and start

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Watch the logs for the green rocket message and copy the **Base URL** (e.g. `https://random-words.trycloudflare.com/v1`).

#### 3. Configure Cursor

Follow the same Cursor configuration steps described in [Configure Cursor](#3-configure-cursor) below.

#### Docker commands

```bash
# Start in background
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop
docker compose down
```

### Option B: Local installation

### 1. Installation
First, install dependencies. This will automatically download the correct `cloudflared` binary for your OS:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Proxy
In your terminal, run:
```bash
npm start
```
Watch for the big green rocket icon. Copy the **Base URL** (e.g., `https://random-words.trycloudflare.com/v1`).

### 3. Configure Cursor
1.  Open **Cursor Settings** (`Cmd + Shift + J` or Click the gear icon).
2.  Go to **Models** > **OpenAI**.
3.  **CRITICAL**: Enable the **"Override OpenAI Base URL"** toggle.
4.  Paste your **New Base URL** into the field.
5.  (Optional but Recommended) **Restart Cursor** to ensure the new networking configuration is fully picked up by the internal AI engine.

### 4. Model Selection
In the Cursor sidebar or Composer, select one of these IDs:
*   `ag-pro`: Gemini 3 Pro (High intelligence, architecture).
*   `ag-flash`: Gemini 3 Flash (Sub-second latency, quick edits).
*   `ag-sonnet`: Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking model, deep reasoning).
*   `ag-opus`: Claude 4.5 Opus (Maximum logic, complex debugging).
*   `ag-haiku`: Gemini 2.5 Lite (Fast and efficient).

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **400 Error (Missing Thought Signature)**: This is fixed! Ensure you are running the latest version of this proxy.
*   **Invalid URL Error**: This means your tunnel URL has changed or expired. Restart the proxy and copy the new URL from the terminal.
*   **EADDRINUSE**: If you see "Address already in use", run `lsof -t -i:3000 | xargs kill -9` to clear the previous process.
*   **Docker: Auth status not found**: Verify `AUTH_DB_HOST_PATH` in `.env` points to your real `state.vscdb` file and that you are logged into Antigravity/Cursor on the host.
*   **Docker: `AUTH_DB_HOST_PATH` required**: Create `.env` from `.env.example` before running `docker compose up`.
